## 📊 Key Learnings Summary

### Performance (From appointment_comparison project)

| Optimization | Impact | Difficulty |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Early filtering before $unwind | 2-3x faster | Easy |
| Dynamic date range filtering | 2-3x faster | Easy |
| Batch processing (vs per-row) | 50-100x faster | Easy |
| Proper indexing | 10-100x faster | Medium |
| **Combined effect** | **4x faster** | Easy-Medium |

**Result**: 50 minutes → 12 minutes for 2,127 records

---

### Top 5 Patterns (From best practices guide)

1. **Early Filtering**: Always filter at root level before $unwind operations
2. **Batch Processing**: Never query one record at a time (use $in with 50-500 IDs)
3. **Dynamic Date Ranges**: Calculate from input data to reduce MongoDB scan
4. **Hierarchical Statistics**: Track failure types separately with tree-style reporting
5. **Math Verification**: Always verify statistics add up correctly

---

### Common Pitfalls (To Avoid)

1. ❌ Processing records one-by-one instead of batching
2. ❌ Unwinding before filtering (processes 100% of documents)
3. ❌ Not tracking WHY validation failed (generic "failed" message)
4. ❌ Assuming indexes are used without verifying with explain()
5. ❌ Not testing with small samples before full runs

## 🔧 Quick Start Template

When starting a new validation project:

```bash
# 1. Create project structure
mkdir -p my_project/{src/my_project,data/{input,output},logs,tests,docs,config}

# 2. Copy essential docs
cp docs/MONGODB_VALIDATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md my_project/docs/

# 3. Review checklist
# - Read MONGODB_VALIDATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md
# - Review appointment_comparison/LESSONS_LEARNED.md for examples
# - Set up standard project structure
# - Plan batch processing from the start
# - Add --limit flag for testing
# - Implement early filtering strategy
# - Track statistics with math verification

# 4. Test workflow
python my_project/run.py --limit 10      # Smoke test (seconds)
python my_project/run.py --limit 100     # Validation (1-2 min)
python my_project/run.py                 # Full run (only after above pass)

# 5. After completion
# - Create LESSONS_LEARNED.md with project-specific insights
# - Update repository best practices if new patterns discovered
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarking Template

```python
# Add to your validation script
import time

start_time = time.time()
total_rows = len(rows)

for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
    batch_start = time.time()
    
    # Process batch
    process_batch(batch)
    
    batch_elapsed = time.time() - batch_start
    total_elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    
    processed = (i + 1) * batch_size
    rate = processed / total_elapsed
    remaining = (total_rows - processed) / rate if rate > 0 else 0
    
    logger.info(
        f"Batch {i+1}: {batch_elapsed:.1f}s | "
        f"Total: {total_elapsed:.1f}s | "
        f"Rate: {rate:.1f} rows/sec | "
        f"ETA: {remaining:.0f}s"
    )
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deploying validation tool:

- [ ] Runs successfully with `--limit 10` (< 10 seconds)
- [ ] Produces correct results with `--limit 100` (1-2 minutes)
- [ ] Statistics add up correctly (math verification passes)
- [ ] MongoDB queries use indexes (verified with explain())
- [ ] Progress logged every 100 records
- [ ] Failures tracked by type (not generic "failed")
- [ ] Output is idempotent (running twice = same result)
- [ ] Required fields validated before processing
- [ ] Missing data handled gracefully (no crashes)
- [ ] README has clear usage examples
