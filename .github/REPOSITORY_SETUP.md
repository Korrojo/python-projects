# Repository Setup & Configuration Guide

This document provides instructions for configuring the GitHub repository settings and branch protection rules.

## Repository URL

**https://github.com/Korrojo/python-projects**

## Initial Setup Completed ✅

The following has been automatically configured:

- [x] Repository created with public visibility
- [x] Initial commit pushed to `main` branch
- [x] Issues enabled
- [x] Discussions enabled
- [x] Wiki disabled (using docs/ directory instead)
- [x] Projects disabled
- [x] Delete branch on merge enabled
- [x] Auto-merge enabled
- [x] Squash merge allowed
- [x] Merge commits allowed

## Manual Configuration Steps

### 1. Branch Protection Rules (Recommended)

Configure branch protection for the `main` branch:

**Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule**

#### Branch name pattern: `main`

**Protect matching branches:**

- [x] **Require a pull request before merging**
  - [x] Require approvals: 1
  - [ ] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - [ ] Require review from Code Owners
  - [ ] Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews

- [x] **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required status checks:
    - `Code Quality & Linting`
    - `Test Suite (ubuntu-latest, 3.11)`
    - `Security Scan`
    - `CodeQL`

- [x] **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- [x] **Require signed commits** (optional but recommended)

- [ ] **Require linear history** (optional - prevents merge commits)

- [ ] **Include administrators** (optional - apply rules to admins too)

- [x] **Allow force pushes** → Specify who can force push
  - Only allow specific people/teams (maintainers only)

- [ ] **Allow deletions** (keep unchecked)

#### Additional Branch Protection (Optional)

Create similar rules for `develop` branch if using Git Flow:

**Branch name pattern: `develop`**
- Similar settings as main, but may allow fewer restrictions

### 2. Repository Topics

Add relevant topics to improve discoverability:

**Settings → General → Topics**

Suggested topics:
- `python`
- `python3`
- `mongodb`
- `pymongo`
- `data-validation`
- `data-processing`
- `healthcare`
- `csv-processing`
- `automation`
- `python311`
- `mongodb-atlas`
- `pytest`
- `black`
- `ruff`

### 3. About Section

**Settings → General → About**

- Description: ✅ Already set
- Website: (optional) Add documentation site if available
- Topics: ✅ Configure as above

### 4. Security Settings

**Settings → Security → Code security and analysis**

Enable the following:

- [x] **Dependency graph** (should be enabled by default)
- [x] **Dependabot alerts**
- [x] **Dependabot security updates**
- [x] **Grouped security updates**
- [x] **Dependabot version updates** (via `.github/dependabot.yml` - ✅ already configured)
- [x] **Code scanning** → CodeQL analysis (via workflow - ✅ already configured)
- [x] **Secret scanning**
- [x] **Push protection** (prevents pushing secrets)

### 5. Actions Permissions

**Settings → Actions → General**

- [x] **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**
- [x] **Require approval for first-time contributors**
- Workflow permissions:
  - [x] **Read repository contents and packages permissions**
  - [x] **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

### 6. Environments (Optional - for production deployments)

**Settings → Environments**

Create environments for deployment protection:

#### Environment: `production`
- Required reviewers: [Add team/user]
- Wait timer: 0 minutes
- Deployment branches: Only `main` branch
- Environment secrets: Add production credentials here

### 7. Labels

**Issues → Labels**

The following labels are automatically created:
- `bug` ✅
- `enhancement` ✅
- `dependencies` ✅ (via Dependabot)
- `python` ✅ (via Dependabot)
- `github-actions` ✅ (via Dependabot)

**Recommended additional labels:**

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `documentation` | `0075ca` | Improvements or additions to documentation |
| `good first issue` | `7057ff` | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | `008672` | Extra attention is needed |
| `question` | `d876e3` | Further information is requested |
| `wontfix` | `ffffff` | This will not be worked on |
| `duplicate` | `cfd3d7` | This issue or PR already exists |
| `invalid` | `e4e669` | This doesn't seem right |
| `performance` | `f9d0c4` | Performance improvements |
| `refactor` | `fbca04` | Code refactoring |
| `testing` | `0e8a16` | Related to testing |
| `security` | `b60205` | Security-related issues |
| `project:common_config` | `c5def5` | Related to common_config |
| `project:patients_validator` | `c5def5` | Related to patients_hcmid_validator |
| `project:automate_refresh` | `c5def5` | Related to automate_refresh |

### 8. Collaborators & Teams (If working with a team)

**Settings → Collaborators and teams**

- Add collaborators with appropriate permissions
- Create teams for different project areas
- Configure code review assignments

### 9. Webhooks & Integrations (Optional)

**Settings → Webhooks**

Consider adding webhooks for:
- Slack/Discord notifications
- CI/CD pipelines
- Issue tracking systems
- Code coverage services (Codecov)

### 10. GitHub Pages (Optional)

**Settings → Pages**

If you want to host documentation:
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: `gh-pages` or `main` with `/docs` folder
- Custom domain: (optional)

## Verification Checklist

After configuration, verify:

- [ ] CI/CD workflows run successfully
- [ ] Branch protection prevents direct pushes to main
- [ ] Dependabot creates PRs for dependency updates
- [ ] Security scanning alerts appear in Security tab
- [ ] Issue templates work correctly
- [ ] PR template appears on new PRs
- [ ] Labels are properly configured
- [ ] Repository description and topics are visible

## Best Practices for Repository Management

### Commit Messages
Follow Conventional Commits format:
```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Testing updates

### Pull Request Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push branch and create PR
4. Wait for CI checks to pass
5. Request review
6. Address feedback
7. Merge when approved

### Release Process
1. Update CHANGELOG.md
2. Bump version in relevant files
3. Create and push version tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
5. GitHub Actions will create release automatically

### Security
- Never commit `.env` files
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review and fix Dependabot alerts promptly
- Rotate credentials if exposed
- Use environment secrets for sensitive data
